At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the
challenges that wait us in the next century. It is our great good fortune that time and
chance have put us in not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but
on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs, a moment that will define our
course, and our character, for decades to come. We must keep our old democracy
forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let is set our sights
upon a land of new promise.
